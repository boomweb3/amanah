# Amānah – Ethical Trust & Ledger Management

**Amānah** is a privacy-first web application designed to help individuals and communities record, manage, and honor debts and trusts in line with Islamic principles, specifically inspired by **Quran 2:282** (the Verse of Debt).

## 🧠 The Concept
In many cultures and communities, informal debts (between family and friends) are often forgotten, leading to broken trust and social conflict. Amānah treats debt not just as a financial transaction, but as a **moral responsibility**.

## ✅ Core Capabilities

### 1. The Ethical Ledger
- **Multiple Entry Types**: Track standard **Debts**, **Amānahs** (items held in trust), and **Qard Hasan** (interest-free beneficent loans).
- **Bi-Directional**: Clearly view "My Responsibilities" (what I owe) versus "My Trusts" (what is owed to me).
- **Status Lifecycle**: Manage records from *Pending* to *Confirmed*, *Fulfilled*, or even *Forgiven*.

### 2. AI-Driven Ethical Inspiration
Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**, the app provides:
- **Spiritual Reminders**: Ayah and Hadith snippets to motivate the honoring of trusts.
- **Gentle Reminder Templates**: Dignified communication templates for following up with creditors or debtors.
- **Resolution Advice**: Guidance on how to navigate financial difficulty with transparency.

### 3. Resolution & Forgiveness
- **Convert to Charity**: Tools to help parties agree on converting an outstanding debt into Sadaqah (with consent).
- **Forgiveness Tracking**: A dignified way to record when a debt has been forgiven by the creditor.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Zen-Islamic Aesthetic**: Minimalist, calm, and focused. Uses an Emerald and Slate palette to reduce financial stress and promote clarity.
- **Privacy-First**: No public social feeds. This is a personal ledger between you and your moral obligations.
